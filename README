MATHEMATICAL MODEL MULTIPLE MYELOMA
The goal was to make fraction and number models that simulate the interactions
between four cell types in the MM microenvironment: drug-sensitive MM cells
(MMd), resistant MM cells (MMr), osteoblasts (OB) and osteoclasts (OC). All
models used collective interactions and were made in the framework of evolutionary
game theory. The models were utilised to determine the effect of traditional and
adaptive therapy and to study the impact of different inhibitor (IH) strengths,
administration durations and holiday durations on the cell type. In addition,
the IH holiday duration, administration duration and strength were optimised.


PYTHON AND LIBRARY VERSION
The models were written in Python code (version 3.11.4) using Atom (version 1.60.0).
Some libraries need to be installed to run the codes in the code folder.

Libraries that need to be installed for MM_model_frac_IH_inf.py,
MM_model_nr_IH_inf.py and MM_model_nr_IH_inf_mutation.py:
* numpy (version 1.25.2)
    - install: python -m pip install numpy==1.25.2
* matplotlib (version 3.7.2)
    - install: python -m pip install matplotlib==3.7.2
* pandas (version 2.2.2)
    - install: python -m pip install pandas==2.2.2
* scipy (version 1.13.1)
    - install: python -m pip install scipy==1.13.1


FRACTION MODEL: MM_model_frac_IH_inf.py
MM_model_frac_IH_inf.py contains the code with the mathematical formulas
simulating the fraction dynamics of the MMd, MMr, OC and OB. It contains code to
make figures showing the effect of the WMMd IH, MMd GF IH and IH combination on
the cell fractions for different administration periods and strengths. The IHs
not only affect the MMd but also the OC and OB.

NUMBER MODEL WITHOUT RESISTANCE MUTATIONS: MM_model_nr_IH_inf.py
MM_model_nr_IH_inf.py contains the code with the mathematical formulas simulating
the number dynamics of the MMd, MMr, OC and OB. It contains code to make figures
showing the effect of the WMMd IH, MMd GF IH and IH combination on the cell numbers
for different administration periods and strengths. Furthermore, it contains a
(weighted) optimisation to find the best holiday duration, administration duration
and IH strength simultaneously. The IHs not only affect the MMd but also the OC
and OB.

NUMBER MODEL WITH RESISTANCE MUTATIONS: MM_model_nr_IH_inf_mutation.py
MM_model_nr_IH_inf_mutation.py contains the code with the mathematical formulas
simulating the number dynamics of the MMd, MMr, OC and OB. The MMd can become MMr
via a mutation that happens at a specified rate. It contains code to make figures
showing the effect of the WMMd  IH, the MMd GF IH and a combination on the cell
numbers for different administration periods and strengths. Furthermore, it
contains a (weighted) optimisation to find the best administration duration,
holiday duration and IH strength simultaneously. The IHs not only affect the MMd
but also the OC and OB.


TEST THE CODES
To test some of the functions in every code file, doc tests are added to the code.
These are automatically run when the specific function is run.


THE DATA
The folder data contains a folder per model with all the generated data that is
used to make figures and tables. The folders data contains are:
* data_model_frac_IH_inf: contains all the data obtained from the model simulating
                          cell type fractions.
* data_model_nr_IH_inf: contains all the data obtained from the model simulating
                          cell type numbers without resistance mutations.
* data_model_nr_IH_inf_mutation: contains all the data obtained from the model
                          simulating cell type numbers with resistance mutations


THE VISUALISATION
The folder visualisation contains a folder per model in which all the made figures
are stored. The folders which visualisation contains are:
* results_model_frac_IH_inf: contains all the figures obtained from the model
                            simulating cell-type fractions.
* results_model_nr_IH_inf; contains all the figures obtained from the model
                            simulating cell type numbers without resistance
                            mutations.
* results_model_nr_IH_inf_mutation: contains all the figures obtained from the
                            model simulating cell type numbers with resistance
                            mutation.
